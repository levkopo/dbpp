# dbpp
dbpp is a library that simplifies database queries by collecting them into one class.

# **WARNING! Repository migrated to https://github.com/PPEco/dbpp**

## Installation
dbpp requires composer and php 8.0 or higher.

For installation run this command in composer:
```
composer require levkopo/dbpp
```

## Usage
The main class for dbpp is Database.
Create a class extended from Database from dbpp.

```php
class SimpleDatabase extends Database {

}
```

Create a class that will contain all the queries for a specific table.
The class should be extended from the Dao class from dbpp.

```php
class TableDao extends Dao {

}
```

Create functions with query annotations from dbpp.
They can be Query and Insert.
Functions should call a function from parent (IDE may throw an error, but don't worry).

```php
class TableDao extends Dao {
    #[Query("SELECT * FROM `table`")
    public function getAll(): array|false {
        parent::getAll();
    }
    
    #[Query("SELECT * FROM `table` WHERE `id` = :id")
    public function getById(int $id){
        parent::getAll($id);
    }
    
    #[Insert("table")
    public function insert(Value $value): bool{
        parent::insert($value);
    }
}
```

Link your Dao to Database via class properties.
```php
class SimpleDatabase extends Database {
   public TableDao $table;
}
```

Well, the final steps. 
Create PDO object and call static method from DBPP: init
```php
$pdo = new PDO(*data*);
$database = new SimpleDatabase();
DBPP::init($database, $pdo);
```

Now you can call methods from the Database class
